This will serve as a brief description of your project. Limit this to three sentences because it can become overly long at that point. This copy should draw the user in and make she/him want to read more.

# First Milestone
  

My first milestone was to set up the smart car chassis, make it move, and make it stop based on ultrasonic sensor input. After sautering the wire connections to the motors and the battery, I assembled the chassis. The chassis consisted of two acryllic plates, acryllic fasteners, and standoffs. I used the fasteners to attch the motors to one plate, and then screwed in the standoffs to mount the second plate on top of the first. Afterwards, I connected the jumper wires from the motors to the terminals on the LN298 motor driver.In order to turn, go forward, and backward, I coupled the motors vertically, so that the wheels on the left side worked as one unit, and the wheels on the right side as another. In addition, I connected the positive wire from an external battery to the 12V terminal on the motor driver, and the negative wire from the battery to the ground terminal. Finally,to connect the motor driver to the Rasberry Pi, I plugged in 6 jumper wires on the input pins of the driver, and pligged them into the GPIO pins on the Rasberry Pi.   For a firrst pass setting up and hooking up the Raspberry Pi and all the necessary components onto my tv. The heatsinks, the sd card, and the controller were all added to ensure that the Raspberry Pi was working. Instead of the Raspberry Pi Os software, I had to first download a different software called Retro Pie. With Retro Pie, I needed to download an Imager for Raspberry Pi. Raspberry Pi Imager automatically downloads a list of the latest versions of Raspbian supported by the Raspberry Pi. Raspbian is the typical Raspberry Pi Os software, the one I needed on the Raspberry Pi was Retro Pi. With the included SD card, I plugged in the SD into my computer and launched the Imager. The imager allowed me to set the Operating System to Retro Pi instead of Raspbian onto the SD card. With the OS imaged onto the SD, I plugged the SD card back into the Raspberry Pi and rebooted the system and Retro Bi booted up.
