# First Milestone
  

My first milestone was to set up the smart car chassis, make it move, and make it stopped based on ultrasonic sensor input. In addition, I setup my Rasberry Pi. After sautering the wire connections to the motors and the battery, I assembled the chassis. The chassis consisted of two acryllic plates, acryllic fasteners, and standoffs. I used the fasteners to attch the motors to one plate, and then screwed in the standoffs to mount the second plate on top of the first. For a firrst pass setting up and hooking up the Raspberry Pi and all the necessary components onto my tv. The heatsinks, the sd card, and the controller were all added to ensure that the Raspberry Pi was working. Instead of the Raspberry Pi Os software, I had to first download a different software called Retro Pie. With Retro Pie, I needed to download an Imager for Raspberry Pi. Raspberry Pi Imager automatically downloads a list of the latest versions of Raspbian supported by the Raspberry Pi. Raspbian is the typical Raspberry Pi Os software, the one I needed on the Raspberry Pi was Retro Pi. With the included SD card, I plugged in the SD into my computer and launched the Imager. The imager allowed me to set the Operating System to Retro Pi instead of Raspbian onto the SD card. With the OS imaged onto the SD, I plugged the SD card back into the Raspberry Pi and rebooted the system and Retro Bi booted up.
